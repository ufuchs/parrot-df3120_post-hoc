This patch fixes the kernel message

  's3c-rtc s3c-2410-rtc: hctosys: invalid date/time'

Let's start.

There are two options:

1.Meanwhile you have modifed/adjusted the kernel configuration. It's no longer virgin.

  So you have to go to the directory 'kernel-config-already-modified'.

2.You are proud of your brand-new installed 'minifs'.
  In this case you have to go to 'kernel-config-yet-virgin'

The READMEs in this subdirectories will give you further informations.
