In case you have already modified your kernel configuration you can get a merge conflict.

To aviod this you should disable the real time clock by hand:

  Invoke './df3120_minifs_build.sh kernel_menuconfig'

  Go to down to 

    Device Drivers 					// Press 'Select' button

  Then search for

    [*] Real Time Clock					// Press 'Select' button

  Then set the focus on

    [*]  Set system time from RTC on startup and resume	// Press space bar to deselect

  Press 'Exit' button until the message box appears which will ask you to save the new kernel configuration.

  Press 'Yes' button.

  Invoke './df3120_minifs_build.sh' to compile the kernel with the new configuration.
