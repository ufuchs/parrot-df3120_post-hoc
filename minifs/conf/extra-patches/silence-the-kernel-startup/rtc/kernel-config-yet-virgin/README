Use this in case of a fresh installed 'minifs'.

In case of a modified/adjusted 'minifs' you can give it a try. 

But it's possible to run into a merge conflict.

Let's start:

  1.Check for conflicts:

    git apply --check rtc.patch

    If you run into trouble stop here and switch to the directory 'kernel-config-already-modified'.
  
  2.Patch your 'config_kernel.conf'

    git am --signoff < rtc.patch
